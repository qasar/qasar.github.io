Copy this _exactly_. Send me 1 sample and when it looks good and you've gotten my thumbs up, then we can do the full batch of introduction requests. 

The <span class="green-bold">red text</span> is what you need to edit.

Hi Qasar,

Great catching up with you. <span class="green-bold">[ 1 sentance about how we know each other like "Been a long time since our Google days, etc."]</span>

Below my signature is some info about the company. I think <span class="green-bold">[FUND PARTNER NAME OR FUND NAME]</span> could be a great fit.

Thank you,  
<span class="green-bold">[Your name]</span>
