Copy this _exactly_. Send me 1 sample and when it looks good and you've gotten my thumbs up, then we can do the full batch of introduction requests. 

The <span class="editable-text">red text</span> is what you need to edit.



<table style="border: none; border-collapse: collapse;">
<tr><td style="border: none; padding: 0; padding-right: 0.5rem;"><strong>From:</strong></td><td style="border: none; padding: 0;"><span class="editable-text">Ideally the CEO</span></td></tr>
<tr><td style="border: none; padding: 0; padding-right: 0.5rem;"><strong>To:</strong></td><td style="border: none; padding: 0;"><span class="editable-text">Qasar (work email so it gets processed quicly)</span></td></tr>
<tr><td style="border: none; padding: 0; padding-right: 0.5rem;"><strong>CC:</strong></td><td style="border: none; padding: 0;"><span class="editable-text">You're co-founders</span></td></tr>

Hi Qasar,

Great catching up with you. <span class="editable-text">[ 1 sentance about how we know each other like "Been a long time since our Google days, etc."]</span>

Below my signature is some info about the company. I think <span class="editable-text">[FUND PARTNER NAME OR FUND NAME]</span> could be a great fit.

Thank you,  
<span class="editable-text">[Your name]</span>
