I work at Y Combinator where I invest in early stage technology companies. 

One of my favorite phrases is "non est ad astra mollis e terris via" which means "there is no easy way from the earth to the stars". That sums up my life philosophy pretty accurately.

I try to put my best thoughts on twitter: @qasar. 

You can also find me on snapchat: @qasar.
