I was an engineer, then got a MBA. I've started two companies, with the second one being acquired by Google. After, I went to Y Combinator where I invested in early stage technology companies and served as the COO. I'm now, and hopefully forever, working at <a href="https://applied.co" target="_blank">Applied</a>. For me, better or worse, work is worship. 

Everything I know, I put on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/qasar" target="_blank">@qasar</a>.
