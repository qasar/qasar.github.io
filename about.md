About me: I was an engineer, then got an MBA. I've started two companies, with the second one being acquired by Google. After, I went to Y Combinator where I invested in early stage technology companies. I'm now working on something new. For me, for better or worse, work is worship. 

Everything I know, I put on twitter: @qasar.
