I was an engineer, then got a MBA. I've started two companies, with the second one being acquired by Google. After, I went to Y Combinator where I invested in early stage technology companies and served as the COO. I'm now working on something new. For me, better or worse, work is worship. 

Everything I know, I put on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/qasar" target="_blank">@qasar</a>.
