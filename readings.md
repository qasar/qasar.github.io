<p>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</p>

<p>I read this book long before I started investing. It casts a long shadow on the way I think. Most specifically not to over learn in early stage investing in both success and failure. Taleb argues that events that happen with little help from luck are more resistant to randomness. What I learn from that is that there should be some process to drive repeatable outcomes, even in something with as much variance as early stage technology investing.</p>

<p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</p>

<p>This book holds a special significance in my development. It has had a reverberating impact on the way I think about my life and actions. It also serves as an informal historical guide pre-partition India and gives me pride in my South Asian hertiage.</p>

<p>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</p>

<p>A black swan is an event, positive or negative, that is deemed improbable yet causes massive consequences. In this groundbreaking and prophetic book, Taleb shows in a playful way that Black Swan events explain almost everything about our world, and yet we—especially the experts—are blind to them.</p>
