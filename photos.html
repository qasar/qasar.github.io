"Photography is not like painting. There is a creative fraction of a second when you are taking a picture. Your eye must see a composition or an expression that life itself offers you, and you must know with intuition when to click the camera. -Henri Cartier-Bresson",
"Dare mighty things. -Theodore Roosevelt",
"If you look for the bad in people expecting to find it, you surely will. -Abraham Lincoln",	
"We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring, will be to arrive where we started, and know the place for the first time. -T. S. Eliot",
"I am by nature war-like. To attack is my instinct. -Nietzsche",
"Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life. -Pablo Picasso",
"He who studies how things originated, will achieve the clearest view of them. -Aristotle",
"Don't hit at all if it is honorably possible. But never hit soft. -Theodore Roosevelt",
"When I admire the wonder of a sunset, my soul expands in worship of the Creator. -Mahatma Gandhi",		
"To a mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders. -Chuang-Tzu",
"I prayed for twenty years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs. -Frederick Douglass",		
"I am Time, the destroyer of all. I have come to consume the world. -Bhagavad Gita",
"By protecting others, you save yourself. If you only think of yourself, you'll only destroy yourself. -Akira Kurosawa",
"If you think you're free, there's no escape possible. -Ram Dass",
"Those who seek absolute power, even though they seek it to do what they regard as good, are simply demanding the right to enforce their own version of heaven on earth. And let me remind you, they are the very ones who always create the most hellish tyrannies. Absolute power does corrupt, and those who seek it must be suspect and must be opposed. - Barry Goldwater",
"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings; look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair! -Percy Shelley",
"God is on the side with the best artillery -Napoleon Bonaparte",
"Under capitalism, man exploits man. Under communism, it's just the opposite. -John Kenneth Galbraith",		
"Willingly would I burn to death like Phaeton, were this the price for reaching the sun and learning its shape, its size and its substance. -Eudoxus of Cnidus",

"Power concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and it never will. -Frederick Douglass",
"Wisdom comes through suffering - Aeschylus",
"Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. -Robert Brault",
"The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good. -Samuel Johnson",
"If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion. -His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama",
"In the republic of mediocrity, genius is dangerous. -Robert G. Ingersoll",
"At about three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 'My God! My God! Why have you abandoned me!' -Matthew 27:46",
"These are a collection of photos I've taken over the years. The quotes I've attached to the photos are often related to them but not always. I now shoot with a Leica M11P, but not a single photo in this set was taken with that camera. Almost all the photos are from when I used a Fujifilm X100F, which I shot with for over 10 years. Both setups are, in practice, based on a 35mm focal length."
