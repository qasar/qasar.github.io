"Dare mighty things. -Theodore Roosevelt",
"Photography is not like painting. There is a creative fraction of a second when you are taking a picture. Your eye must see a composition or an expression that life itself offers you, and you must know with intuition when to click the camera. -Henri Cartier-Bresson",
"If you look for the bad in people expecting to find it, you surely will. -Abraham Lincoln",	
"We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring, will be to arrive where we started, and know the place for the first time. -T. S. Eliot",
"I am by nature war-like. To attack is my instinct. -Nietzsche",
"Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life. -Pablo Picasso",
"Governments exist to protect the rights of minorities. The loved and the rich need no protection: they have many friends and few enemies. - Wendell Phillips",
"Don't hit at all if it is honorably possible. But never hit soft. -Theodore Roosevelt",
"When I admire the wonder of a sunset, my soul expands in worship of the Creator. -Mahatma Gandhi",		
"To a mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders. -Chuang-Tzu",
"I prayed for twenty years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs. -Frederick Douglass",		
"I am Time, the destroyer of all. I have come to consume the world. -Bhagavad Gita",
"The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. -Mohandas Gandhi",
"If you think you're free, there's no escape possible. -Ram Dass",
"Those who seek absolute power, even though they seek it to do what they regard as good, are simply demanding the right to enforce their own version of heaven on earth. And let me remind you, they are the very ones who always create the most hellish tyrannies. Absolute power does corrupt, and those who seek it must be suspect and must be opposed. - Barry Goldwater",
"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings; look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair! -Percy Shelley",
"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. -General Eisenhower",
"Under capitalism, man exploits man. Under communism, it's just the opposite. -John Kenneth Galbraith",		
"Willingly would I burn to death like Phaeton, were this the price for reaching the sun and learning its shape, its size and its substance. -Eudoxus of Cnidus",
"It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society. -Krishnamurti",
"Power concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and it never will. -Frederick Douglass",
"Wisdom comes through suffering - Aeschylus",
"Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. -Robert Brault",
"The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good. -Samuel Johnson",
"If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion. -His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama",
"Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, 'Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up.' Man bursts into tears. Says 'But Doctor... I am Pagliacci.' Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains. -Rorschach",
"At about three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 'My God! My God! Why have you abandoned me!' -Matthew 27:46"
